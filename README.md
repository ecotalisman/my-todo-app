# Python Mega Course: Learn Python in 60 Days, Build 20 Apps

Welcome to the [Python Mega Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/) on Udemy, an ambitious program designed to take you from Python beginner to Python developer in just 60 days. This course is flexible and allows you to choose your learning path. You can complete the entire course to become a full-fledged Python developer, or you can select any of the 20 project-based lessons to master specific areas of Python.

## Course Description

This course covers everything you need to know about Python, starting from the basics and moving on to more advanced topics. By the end of this course, you'll have a firm grasp of Python and its applications, and you'll be able to build complex applications with ease.

Over the course of 60 days, you will learn Python programming through practical, hands-on projects. Each project is designed to reinforce what you've learned and give you the opportunity to apply your skills in a practical setting. You will learn to code in Python, work with Python libraries, build Python applications, work with databases, and much more.

## Project: Todo App

One of the key projects in this course is the development of a `Todo App`. This project is covered from Day 1 to Day 20. The aim of this project is to provide a hands-on experience of using Python in a real-world application. 

## Deployment of Todo App

After the successful development of the Todo App, the next step is to make it accessible to the world. The app is deployed on two different platforms to provide a more reliable and versatile user experience.

1. **Heroku**: The Todo App is deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. You can access it at the following link: [https://todo-app-ecotalisman-cfc192f5c240.herokuapp.com/](https://todo-app-ecotalisman-cfc192f5c240.herokuapp.com/)

2. **Streamlit**: The app is also deployed on Streamlit, a platform that allows you to easily share your machine learning projects. Here is the Streamlit link for the app: [https://ecotalisman-my-todo-app-web-g1n9hi.streamlit.app/](https://ecotalisman-my-todo-app-web-g1n9hi.streamlit.app/)
